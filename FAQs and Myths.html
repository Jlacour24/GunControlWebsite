            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                        <ul>
                <li><strong>What are the current gun control laws in the United States?</strong></li>
                <p>Some of the gun control laws have been... The National Firearms Act (1934) regulates the sale and transfer of certain firearms, including machine guns and short-barreled rifles, to enhance public safety by imposing strict regulations and background checks. The Gun Control Act (1968) aims to prevent firearm sales to individuals deemed dangerous or irresponsible by establishing prohibited categories and regulating interstate commerce in firearms. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993) mandates federal background checks on firearm purchasers to prevent sales to prohibited individuals, enhancing the effectiveness of gun control measures.</p>
                <li><strong>How do background checks work for purchasing firearms?</strong></li>
                <p> Federal law requires federally licensed firearms dealers (but not private sellers) to initiate a background check on the purchaser prior to sale of a firearm. Federal law provides states with the option of serving as a state “point of contact” and conducting their own background checks using state, as well as federal, records and databases, or having the checks performed by the FBI using only the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) database. (Note that state files are not always included in the federal database.)</p> 
                <li><a href="https://guides.sll.texas.gov/gun-laws/background-checks">Texas.gov</a></li> 
                <li><strong>What is the difference between semi-automatic and automatic weapons?</strong></li>
<p> Semi-Automatic weapons fire one round or shot each time the trigger is pulled, automatically ejecting the shell or casing, and loading a new bullet into the chamber. It will only fire one time when you pull the trigger. Automatic weapons on the other hand, when pulling the trigger you are able to hold the trigger down. This allows the gun to fire a shot or round, eject the shell or casing, and reload another bullet into the chamber, and fire another round all simultaneously, and repeat the process over and over untill the user lets go of the trigger or until the magazine runs out of rounds. </p>

                <li><strong>Do stricter gun control laws reduce gun violence?</strong></li>
<p> The relationship between strict gun control laws and the reduction of violence is complex. While some studies suggest that stricter gun control measures can lead to a decrease in certain types of gun violence. other factors such as socioeconomic conditions, cultural attitudes toward firearms, and enforcement effectiveness also play significant roles. Additionally, the effectiveness of gun control laws can vary depending on their implementation, enforcement, and compliance. What we believe is the reason that stricter gun control laws don't necessarily correlate with safer conditions is because the entire gun control industry is not being funded enough. Yes we have back ground checks but studies show that only 2% of background checks fail due to criminal history. We belive that gun saftey is just as important, if not more important than automobile saftey. The question is why is it easier to obtain a firearm than to aquire a drivers license? To obtain a driverse licens in the U.S., you must first pass an exam led by a professional driving instructor. Why don't we act this serious about firearm saftey and who owns them?
                <li><strong>What is the impact of gun ownership on public safety?</strong></li> <p> This as well is a complex issue with varied perspectives. Proponents argue that responsible gun ownership can enhance public saftey, allowing individuals to defend themselves as well as others. However, critics raise concerns about the potential for increased gun violence. The truth is, the rate of gun ownership in each state in the U.S. does not directly effect the number of gun deaths per year, as in the "Gun Violence" page. </p>

            <h2>Dispelling Myths</h2>
            <p>Let's address some common myths about firearms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Myth: More guns lead to less crime.</li>
<p> According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225935642_The_Impact_of_Gun_and_Gun_Ownership_Levels_on_Violence_Rates#:~:text=Findings%20indicate%20that%20(1)%20gun,generally%20have%20no%20net%20effect">Research Gate</a>, in an article by Gary Kleck and E. Britt Patterson,their assertion suggests, "Findings indicate that (1) gun prevalence levels generally have no net positive effect on total violence rates, (2) homicide, gun assault, and rape rates increase gun prevalence, (3) gun control restrictions have no net effect on gun prevalence levels, and (4) most gun control restrictions generally have no net effect on violence rates. There were, however, some possible exceptions to this last conclusion—of 108 assessments of effects of different gun laws on different types of violence, 7 indicated good support, and another 11 partial support, for the hypothesis of gun control efficacy." In conclusion, some people may say guns actually lead to more crime, and some may say it doesn't change. We believe safer guns = safer people.

                <strong><li>Myth: A small child cannot pull a trigger.</li></strong>
<p> Every year, hundreds of children age 17 and under gain access to a gun and unintentionally shoot themselves or someone else, sometimes fatally. <a href="<a href="https://www.everytown.org/debunking-gun-myths-at-the-dinner-table/">Everytown</a>
                <strong><li>Myth: Gun-free zones are more dangerous.</li></strong>
<p> Gun free zones are not more dangerous. However, they are not safer. Research shows that every one and three adults fear mass shootings at their childrens school. </p>
                <strong><li>Myth: Stricter gun laws won't prevent mass shootings.</li></strong>
<p> We believe that if our country can improve our gun laws and regulations the right way, we will be able to reduce gun violence. </p>
