            <h2>Community Impact</h2>
           
            <p> Here are several different ways firearms have positively impacted gun violence situations. </p>
<h2> Greenwood Park Hall Shooting </h2>
            <img src="https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/presto/2022/07/18/PIND/e7ae1d0a-57aa-4115-8f58-3a9665d121db-071722_GreenwoodParkMallShooting_KW_015.JPG" alt="Community Impact Image">
<p> The Greenwood Park shooting was extremely devistating for its citizens. It could have gone a lot worse if it werent for Elisjsha Dicken. Heres an excerpt from <a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/johnson-county/greenwood/armed-civilian-who-stopped-greenwood-mall-shooter-named-civilian-of-the-year">WRTV Indianapolis</a>, “July 17th started off to be another beautiful day in Greenwood. Unfortunately, it became one of the darkest days in our history. A lone gunman entered the Food Court in the Greenwood Park Mall. As he emerged from the restroom he began firing a rifle, killing 3 people.

Hearing shots ring out, Elisjsha Dicken immediately identified the shooter, took cover behind a pillar, drew his weapon and fired at the shooter from 40 yards away. He was able to eliminate the threat. While doing this Elisjsha also was waving innocent civilians to safety. There were countless number of innocent lives saved that day due to his quick and selfless thinking. The City of Greenwood and the residents here owe a great debt of gratitude to Elisjsha."

<section>  <h2>Aprill 22, Las Vegas</h2>
<p> Local prosecutors determined that a concealed-carry permit holder acted in lawful self-defense when he shot and killed a man who fired a gun at him. The permit holder and a woman were eating fast food in a parking lot when the man, apparently angry over a failed gun purchase earlier in the day, randomly chose to vent his frustrations on them. Police said the man began shooting at the permit holder, who hid behind a trash can and returned fire with at least 11 rounds.

<section><h2>Woman Turns Tables</h2> 
<p> The Levy County Sheriff’s Office received a call around 3 p.m. Easter of a person shot at a duplex in the town of Bronson, authorities said. Officials arrived at the scene and found James Young, Jr., 40, dead on the floor inside the apartment. 

Investigators say Young had "a prior domestic relationship" with the unidentified woman living in the home, and traveled to the duplex armed with a gun to "confront" the woman. The woman was able to fire off one shot that struck Young on the chest and killed him. The woman fled to a neighbor’s home for assistance following the incident. </p> 

<section><p> In these circumstances, firearms saved these people lives. This shows how much guns can positively impact multiple peoples lives. </p>
